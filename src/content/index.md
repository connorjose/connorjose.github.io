# Connor Brunjes
Hi! I'm Connor, a software developer based out of Australia.

Currently working at [Cogstate](https://www.cogstate.com/) where I spend most of my time building digital tools to improve cognitive aliment detection.
Working with these tools currently:
- <span class="simple-icons:dotnet"></span> .NET
- GitHub Actions
- Octopus Deploy
- Angular
- EaselJS
- Azure

Passionate about all things programming I enjoy building tools to help myself and others be more productive. Beyond programming I enjoy music production, rock climbing, skateboarding and traveling.
