# Connor Brunjes
Hi! I'm Connor, a software developer based out of Australia.


Passionate problem solver, I love all things programming. Building tools to improve mine and others productivity and enjoying the art of crafting.

Currently working at [Cogstate](https://www.cogstate.com/) where I spend most of my time building digital tools to improve cognitive aliment detection.
