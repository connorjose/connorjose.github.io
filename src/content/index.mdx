# Connor Brunjes
Hi! I'm Connor, a software developer based out of Australia. 

Currently working at [Cogstate](https://www.cogstate.com/) where I spend most of my time building digital tools to improve cognitive aliment detection.
Some projects I work on include:
- Cognitive games implemented using web technologies
- A platform for designing clinical batteries
- Multiple systems for transforming raw clinical data to usable insights

I'm passionate about turning ideas into real, useful tools that boost productivity and make building things more enjoyable. Check out my full list of __[projects](projects)__ here.
